Here are potential additional features and improvements for the society management system:

1. **Data Validation and Constraints**:
   - Add validation attributes to DTOs (Required, StringLength, Range, etc.)
   - Implement custom validation rules (e.g., valid email format, phone number format)
   - Add business rule validations (e.g., carpet area cannot be greater than built-up area)

2. **Audit Trail**:
   - Add audit fields (CreatedBy, CreatedAt, ModifiedBy, ModifiedAt)
   - Track changes to entities (who made what changes and when)
   - Implement soft delete with deletion tracking

3. **Search and Filtering**:
   - Add pagination support for all list endpoints
   - Implement advanced search filters (by status, type, date range)
   - Add sorting capabilities
   - Support for complex queries (e.g., units by maintenance range)

4. **Resident Management**:
   - Add resident registration and management
   - Track resident history for units
   - Handle resident move-in/move-out processes
   - Manage resident family members

5. **Owner Management**:
   - Enhanced owner profile management
   - Track ownership history
   - Handle ownership transfer process
   - Multiple ownership support (joint owners)

6. **Maintenance Management**:
   - Generate monthly maintenance bills
   - Track maintenance payment history
   - Handle maintenance rate revisions
   - Support for different maintenance calculation methods

7. **Document Management**:
   - Store and manage documents for societies/blocks/units
   - Support for document types (agreements, NOCs, etc.)
   - Document versioning
   - Document access control

8. **Notification System**:
   - Email notifications for important events
   - SMS notifications for critical updates
   - Notification preferences management
   - Notification templates

9. **Reporting**:
   - Generate various reports (occupancy, maintenance collection, etc.)
   - Export data in different formats (PDF, Excel)
   - Custom report builder
   - Scheduled report generation

10. **API Enhancements**:
    - API versioning
    - Rate limiting
    - Better error handling and validation responses
    - API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
    - Response caching

11. **Security Improvements**:
    - Enhanced RBAC with more granular permissions
    - API key authentication for external systems
    - Two-factor authentication
    - IP whitelisting

12. **Integration Features**:
    - Payment gateway integration
    - SMS gateway integration
    - Email service integration
    - Third-party service integrations

13. **Performance Optimizations**:
    - Implement caching strategies
    - Query optimization
    - Lazy loading configurations
    - Bulk operations support

14. **Maintenance Request System**:
    - Create and track maintenance requests
    - Assign requests to maintenance staff
    - Track request status and resolution
    - Feedback system

15. **Visitor Management**:
    - Track visitors to units
    - Pre-approve visitors
    - Generate visitor passes
    - Visitor history

Please let me know which features you'd like to implement first, and I'll proceed with the implementation following the same clean architecture patterns we've used so far.






I'll create a comprehensive API flow documentation and a prompt for building the frontend application. This will help frontend developers or AI agents understand how to interact with our APIs and create a user-friendly interface.

# Society Management System - API Flow & Frontend Development Guide

## Core Flow: Society Creation and Management

### 1. Society Creation Flow
```typescript
// 1. Create Society
POST /api/societies
{
  "name": "Green Valley",
  "registrationNumber": "SOC123",
  "addressLine1": "123 Main St",
  "addressLine2": "Area Name",
  "city": "City",
  "state": "State",
  "country": "Country",
  "pincode": "123456",
  "contactNumber": "+1234567890",
  "email": "contact@greenvalley.com"
}

// 2. Add Block to Society
POST /api/blocks
{
  "societyId": "society-guid",
  "name": "Block A",
  "code": "BLK-A",
  "maintenanceChargePerSqft": 2.5
}

// 3. Add Floor to Block
POST /api/floors
{
  "blockId": "block-guid",
  "floorNumber": 1,
  "floorName": "First Floor"
}

// 4. Add Unit to Floor
POST /api/units
{
  "floorId": "floor-guid",
  "unitNumber": "101",
  "type": "2BHK",
  "builtUpArea": 1200,
  "carpetArea": 950,
  "furnishingStatus": "Semi-Furnished",
  "status": "Available"
}
```

### 2. Hierarchical Data Retrieval
```typescript
// Get Society with all details
GET /api/societies/{id}

// Get Blocks in Society
GET /api/blocks/society/{societyId}

// Get Floors in Block
GET /api/floors/block/{blockId}

// Get Units in Floor
GET /api/units/floor/{floorId}
```


#### Hierarchical Navigation
- Society List → Society Details
- Block List → Block Details
- Floor List → Floor Details
- Unit List → Unit Details

#### Interactive Features
1. **Society Creation Wizard**
   - form with validation
   - Preview and confirmation
   - Success/failure notifications

2. **Block Management**
   - Visual block layout
   - Quick actions menu
   - Maintenance rate calculator

3. **Floor Visualization**
   - Interactive floor plan
   - Unit status indicators
   - Quick unit information

4. **Unit Management**
   - Detailed unit information cards
   - Status updates
   - Maintenance calculation


 **Feature Implementation**
   - Society management
   - Block management
   - Floor management
   - Unit management

- Add role-based access control
